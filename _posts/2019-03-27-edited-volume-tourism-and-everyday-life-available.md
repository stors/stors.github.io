I'm happy to announce that our edited volume *Tourism and Everyday Life in the Contemporary City* is available through our publisher <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Tourism-and-Everyday-Life-in-the-Contemporary-City-1st-Edition/Frisch-Sommer-Stoltenberg-Stors/p/book/9781138580725#" target="_blank"> Routledge</a>. Besides co-editing this book, I contributed to the introduction and authored one chapter myself:

**Living with Guests: Understanding the Reasons for Hosting via Airbnb in a Mobile Society**

The introduction is available on <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=88uGDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&dq=Tourism%20and%20Everyday%20Life%20in%20the%20Contemporary%20City&pg=PT17#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">Google Books</a>. In an upcoming blog post, I will outline my article, which investigates why hosts rent out their couch, room, or apartment on Airbnb.
