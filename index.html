<p>Hi, my name is <b>Natalie Stors</b>,</p>

<p>
I lead the market analysis team at the <a href="https://www.germany.travel/en/about-us/about-us.html">German National Tourist Board</a> in Frankfurt.
Before, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Leisure and Tourism Geography of Trier University in Germany.
My research interests include urban tourism, the sharing economy, and in particular the social construction of space in urban settings.
In my doctoral dissertation titled <i>"Airbnb hosts as actors in new urban tourism: Studies on short-term rental and the construction of tourism space in Berlin"</i>
I investigated the motivation of Airbnb hosts to rent out private space and the resulting spatial implications of these practices.
Apart from my own research, I am a co-founder of the urban research group on New Urban Tourism located at the Georg Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies at Humboldt University Berlin.
You may also visit the <a href="https://newurbantourism.wordpress.com" target="_blank">blog</a> of our research group.
