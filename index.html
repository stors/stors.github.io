<p>Hi, my name is <b>Natalie Stors</b>,</p>

<p>
I am a Professor of Tourism Management at <a href="https://www.hs-harz.de">Harz University of Applied Sciences</a> in Wernigerode, Germany.
My research interests encompass destination development, tourism policy, sustainability, and market research, with a particular focus on urban tourism and the social construction of space in urban settings.
Currently, I am leading the research project <i>"Klimafußabdruck des Tourismus im Harz"</i>, funded by the Ministry of Science, Energy, Climate Protection and Environment of Saxony-Anhalt.
</p>

<p>
Before joining Hochschule Harz, I led the market analysis team at the <a href="https://www.germany.travel/en/about-us/about-us.html">German National Tourist Board</a> in Frankfurt and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Leisure and Tourism Geography of University of Trier.
I am also a co-founder of the <a href="https://newurbantourism.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Urban Research Group New Urban Tourism</a> at the Georg Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies at Humboldt University Berlin.
