I'm a **researcher**, **teaching assistant**, and **Ph.D. student** at the Chair of Leisure and Tourism Geography of Trier University in Germany. The working title of my dissertation is: *"Airbnb-hosts as actors in new urban tourism: The practice of hosting  and the construction of tourism space"*.
